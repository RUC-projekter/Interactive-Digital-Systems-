# Interactive Digital Systems with p5.js
Welcome to the Interactive Digital Systems project! This project explores the fascinating world of interactive digital systems using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding. Our aim is to create a playful and interactive experience that combines object recognition, photography, and culinary exploration.

# Project Overview
In this project, we've harnessed the power of p5.js to achieve the following:
Object Recognition: We've trained Teachable Machines to recognize various objects, making it capable of identifying different ingredients.
Photography: Our system allows users to take X number of photos of different ingredients. This hands-on approach enhances user engagement and interaction.
Recipe Generation: Leveraging a recipe API, we generate unique recipes based on the ingredients you've captured. This adds a delightful element of surprise and creativity to your culinary journey.

# Technologies Used
p5.js: The project is primarily developed using the p5.js library, known for its ease of use in creative coding and interactivity.
Teachable Machines: We've integrated Teachable Machines for object recognition, providing a dynamic and interactive experience.
Recipe API: The recipe generation is powered by a Recipe API, ensuring a wide variety of culinary possibilities.
